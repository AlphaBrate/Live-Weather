## How it functions

The live weather wallpaper is a web application that uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display the current weather conditions in a visually appealing way. When the user visits the website, the application retrieves the current weather data for the user's location using a free geocoding API and a weather API. The weather data includes information such as the current temperature, precipitation, and cloud cover.

Based on the weather data, the application changes the background image and adds animated clouds and lightning effects to the wallpaper. For example, if it is sunny, the background image will show a clear sky and the clouds will be light and fluffy. If it is raining, the background image will show raindrops and the clouds will be dark and heavy. The application also adjusts the brightness and color of the sun and moon based on the time of day and weather conditions.

Users can customize the wallpaper by entering their own API key or location on the settings page. This allows the wallpaper to display the weather conditions for a specific location. Users can also modify the CSS styles in the `css/style.css` file to change the appearance of the wallpaper.

The live weather wallpaper is designed to be used as a web app, so it can be accessed from any device with a web browser. It is also mobile-responsive, so it looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.

## Customization

To customize the wallpaper, you can enter your own API key or location on the settings page. This will allow the wallpaper to display the weather conditions for your specific location.

You can also customize the appearance of the wallpaper by modifying the CSS styles in the `css/style.css` file. This allows you to change the colors, fonts, and layout of the wallpaper to suit your preferences.
